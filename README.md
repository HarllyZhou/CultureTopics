# CultureTopics

This folder contains some summaries and exercises I do for cultural topics. Different folders contain different topics, and the content is updated from time to time.

The structure of each folder should be as such.
1. A target. What is this folder for? Why am I reading this series of paper? What is my relevant research idea? What are the big picture? What are key points?
2. Different notes. I can do one note for one paper, or several papers, depending on how much I learned from the paper.
3. A reference list. Each folder here should have a separate collection (not library) of references in Zotero. Each library.bib file should only contain the relevant papers for this specific folder.
4. Exercises and drafts. I may write drafts for the research ideas. They need not to be perfect, but they need to be preliminarily written, even as exercises. In such exercises, I should at least have:
    [1] Introduction: What is my basic thoughts about this?
    [2] Literature reviews: What are the main references? What is the research gap? What is my possible contribution?
    [3] Model setup: How do I want to build the model? What are the variables? How are their basic dynamics? What are the assumptions? How to validate them?
    [4] Data: I need to get familiar with different data source. In reading relevant empirical, I should learn how to get data from different sources. I should at least have an idea on where to get the data, and get familiar with the data structure of different database.
    [5-1] Empirical strategy: I need to consider basic empirical strategies, like regressions, causal inference technique to use. When reading papers, I need to focus on the empirical strategy in recent research.
    [5-2] Calibration: This is further considered. Before completely solving the model, there is little sense to consider model calibration. But at least, I should specify how data can be used for model estimation.
