# Target for this topic

Currently, my idea to study the intergenerational transmission of gender discrimination and its impact on inequality and growth. Therefore, this series of studies can help me to form a micro-foundation for this study. 

I am basically thinking the fusion of intergenerational effect (parental generation as discipline) and intragenerational effect (the spread of equality reformation), and how the combination shapes the inequality in labour market and the macroeconomy.

The key point is that we must in the end extend this to a macro-economic level, and the core to this is growth! Therefore, this is like an "OLG" model.
